                Ladakh is a high altitude mountainous region bounded by the Karakoram Range from the north and the Great Himalayas in the south. Often described as ‘Moonland' on account of the unique lunar landscape, Ladakh abounds in awesome physical features set in an enormous and spectacular environment. For close to a millennium, the region was an independent mountain kingdom of strategic importance. Leh, the royal capital, was a major crossroads of Asia and a stopping point on the ancient migration routes of the trans-Himalayas, connecting Central Asia with the Indian sub-continent. From here, the old caravan routes led westward through Kashmir to the Silk roads, northward across the Karakorum Pass to Central Asia, eastward across the Chang-thang highlands to Tibet and China, and southward through present-day Himachal Pradesh to the plains of India.

Many migrants have traveled through Ladakh, some settling on the way, giving a distinctive characteristic to its population - from the west, early Dard settlers and later-day invaders from Baltistan; from the east, Tibetan settlers, invaders and rulers; from the north, traders from Yarkand; and much later, Dogra conquerors from Jammu in the south.

                Whenever one thinks of Kashmir, the first thought that comes to mind is that of the charming Dal Lake and the houseboats. The lake is popular for its floating gardens and markets. You can see the reflection of the snow-covered Pir Panjal mountains on its surface. If you wish to escape the crowds at Dal Lake, you can visit Wular Lake, Manasbal Lake or Nagin Lake.
                Glide over the Kashmir valley and enjoy its spectacular views in a hot air balloon. As tourists flock to Kashmir to escape the summer heat, the tourism department has started this service at Zabarwan Park, Srinagar. It’s your chance to witness the idyllic Kashmir, including the snow-clad mountains and the Dal Lake from high above.

                Goa is a paradise where water is turquoise, the beaches have soft white sands and sky changes colour of different hues. It is one of the finest beach destinations of the world where you can find pristine beaches and a laid-back lifestyle. Honeymooners, bachelors and even families can enjoy the exotic Goan beaches because of its wide range of tourist attractions and activities.

Goa is a lot more than just a party capital and travellers explore its land because of the soft sands lying next to the pristine waters of the Arabian Sea with shadowing groves of palm and coconut. Tourists enjoy the scenic beaches in simple ways such as sunbathing under the sun, taking a stroll down the coastline and sipping coconut juice while lazing around. The state is divided into two districts- North Goa and South Goa. North Goa is popular for the lively and touristy beaches such as Calangute, Baga, Anjuna, Candolim and Vagator among others. While South Goa houses some of the most secluded and cleanest beaches of Goa such as Palolem, Betalbatim and Betul Beach among others.
